# 3DPrinter_HyperCube_Marlin_Configuration

Custom Marlin 1.1.4

Changes made to configuration.h and configuration_advanced.h

Issue with undeclared variables in standard system files corrected through the hard declaration of values obtained from previous marlin versions.

Purpose of version control to allow the ease of modification for separate configurations, particularly the change between the use of Z_Min endstop and a capacitive probing sensor.
